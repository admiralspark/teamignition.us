Summary: About the Author

Welcome to my blog! This is mostly a rant space/place I knowledge dump so that I have a quick link to toss up on social media. 

I'm currently working in cybersecurity for a company in the critical infrastructure industry in southcentral Alaska. My background is all over: I've worked with over 70 companies in every industry, from small accounting firms to oil companies and government contractors. I worked my way up to systems and network engineering at my last firm and then found a great opportunity at my current employer, so I jumped roles and here I am!

I'm passionate about helping sysadmins and network engineers become the best they can be. I hope some of my content here will help others think about how they handle these topics at their companies, or maybe encourage you to look into new open-source projects you've been putting off!

Outside of IT, I'm a HAM radio operator (currently playing with DMR!), I've got a passion for building and driving fast cars, and I thoroughly enjoy the outdoors in the Last Frontier. I'm also passionate about our local beer, so if you ever make it up here contact me and we'll have a brew!
