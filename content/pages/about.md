Summary: About the Author

Welcome to my blog! This is mostly a rant space/place I knowledge dump so that I have a quick link to toss up on social media. 

I'm passionate about helping sysadmins and network engineers become the best they can be. I hope some of my content here will help others think about how they handle these topics at their companies, or maybe encourage you to look into new open-source projects you've been putting off!
